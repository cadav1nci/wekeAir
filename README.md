What can I do with the app?

-Finding the shortest route between capital cities //fastest route

-Calculating estimated time for each flight

-Sorting flights by price, distance or time

-Showing graphically the route between capital cities

How to install?

Right now the app is not avaliable for mobile devices, just for desktop.The app was written using the java language, therefore you will need the Java Runtime envirement in your machine in order to excute it. You can use a an IDE such "eclipse" in order to execute it easily.
